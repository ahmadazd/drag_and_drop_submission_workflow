      <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Introduction: Aside from the RT-PCR tests for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 in routine clinical care as well as population-scale
screening, there is an urgent need to increase the number and the efficiency for full viral genome sequencing in order to detect
the variants of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 variants assessment should be easily, rapidly and routinely available in any academic
hospital.
Materials and Methods: SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequencing was performed retrospectively in a single laboratory (LPCE, Louis
Pasteur Hospital, Nice, France) in 103 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. An automated workflow used the Ion Ampliseq SARS-CoV-2
panel, a targeted Next-Generation Assay, on the Genexus Sequencer. The analyses were made from nasopharyngeal swab (NSP) (n =
64) and/or saliva (n = 39) samples. All samples were collected in the metropolitan area of Nice city (France) from September 2020
to March 2021.
Results: The mean turnaround time between RNA extraction to result reports was 30 hours for each run of 15 samples. A strong
correlation was noted for the results obtained between NSP and saliva paired samples, regardless of low viral load and high (&gt;28)
Ct values. After repeated sequencing runs, complete failure of obtaining a valid sequencing result was observed in 4% of samples.
Besides the European strain (B.1.160), various variants were identified, including one variant of concern (B.1.1.7), and different
variants under monitoring.
Discussion: Our data highlight the current feasibility of developing SARS-CoV-2 next generation sequencing approach in a single
hospital center. Moreover, these data showed that using the Ion Ampliseq SARS-CoV-2 Assay, the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is
rapid and efficient not only in NSP but also in saliva samples with a low viral load. The advantages and limitations of this setup are
discussed.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
